<h1>Coffee in Melbourne</h1>
<p>One persons coffee journey around the suburbs of Melbourne in search of the perfect drink.</p>
<p>June 2, 2015</p>
<p>My first day of the Odyssey! I can't believe I finally got every cafe in Melbourne mapped out
    and am now starting this amazing journey. I am equipped with the essentials: a mobile phone, digital
    camera, note pad and a bottle of water. As Lao Tu would have said, &quot A Journey of a
    thousand miles begins with one step.&quot </p>

<p>At St Ali today I read this wonderful poem:<p>
        <pre>    Coffee must always be hot
        It warms the soul
        And awakens the body
        It fends off the sleep
        Like a dragon's
        Fiery breath
        A drink for the gods
        </pre>
